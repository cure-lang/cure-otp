-- THE DEPENDENT handle_call SHAPE (integration spine, server side / item 19). The client boundary
-- (dep_call_boundary) types call(server, req) : ReplyOf(req). The SERVER must produce the matching reply: a
-- gen_server handle_call returns {reply, Reply, NewState}, and here the Reply component has the request's OWN
-- type ReplyOf(request). This is what the `actor` macro currently CANNOT emit -- actor.cure:181 emits a UNIFORM
-- reply_type. handleCall is the target the macro must emit: a total function whose result tuple carries a reply
-- typed per-request, checked per branch against ReplyOf reduced at the matched constructor. It is the same
-- dependent-return discipline as Otp.Meta.Proof.handle, wrapped in the {reply, _, state} tuple.

-- handle_call's result: {reply, <the request's own reply>, new state}. The middle component is ReplyOf request,
