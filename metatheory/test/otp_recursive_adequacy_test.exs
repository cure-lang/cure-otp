  `Otp.Meta.RecursiveAdequacy` — BRec coverage: every tag a recursive behaviour sends is a
  member of its inferred fixed-point interface. Pins the coverage induction (`tset_covers`)
  and the capstone `brec_covers`, which carries a send site through the fixed-point witness
  `rec_fixed`. Cross-checked against Idris (oracle `recursive_coverage`); re-checked every
  build via the stdlib preload.
