  `Otp.Meta.Call` — `gen_server:call` failure/totality (G6): a total call reifies its
  failure (`Replied(r) | Failed(CallError)`), and the kernel's exhaustiveness check
  forces every consumer to handle the failure. The proof is re-checked every build via
  the stdlib preload; these tests pin the safety content — a consumer that ignores the
  `Failed` case is rejected as non-total.
