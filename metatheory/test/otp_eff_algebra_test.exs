  `Otp.Meta.EffAlgebra` — OTP effect programs form a MONOID under sequential composition. Since
  the message operations carry no result, an effectful program is a sequence of commands and
  `seq` is append; `seq_nil_l`/`seq_nil_r`/`seq_assoc` certify `(Eff, seq, ENil)` is a monoid,
  so effect programs can be reassociated and unit-simplified. Cross-checked against Idris
  (oracle `eff_algebra`).
