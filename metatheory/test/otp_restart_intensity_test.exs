defmodule Cure.Otp.MetaRestartIntensityTest do
  @moduledoc """
  `Otp.Meta.RestartIntensity` — the `max_restarts` bound: a supervisor carries a restart budget
  (a `Nat` index), `FRestart` consumes one and requires `S(n)` budget, and a zero-budget
  failure has only `FShutdown`. Re-checked every build via the stdlib preload; these tests pin
  the intensity bound — a supervisor cannot restart beyond its budget.

  The bounded-run liveness theorem (`eventually_down`: from budget `n`, `n` restarts then one
  shutdown reach `Down`) is proved in the shipped module and exercised here — it was formerly
  E6-blocked and is now unblocked by the constructor-argument deferral fix.
