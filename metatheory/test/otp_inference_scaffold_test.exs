  @moduledoc """
  The G9 research scaffolds (`docs/research/process-types/scaffolds/`) are DESIGN ARTIFACTS
  for the open core of mailbox-type inference: the least-fixpoint outer shape
  (`inference_fixpoint.cure`) and the constraint-generation frontier
  (`inference_frontier.cure`), with typed holes (`?name`) for the intractable inner parts.

  These tests pin that the OUTER SHAPES are well-formed — they type-check with their holes,
  so the interfaces the holes must satisfy are real, not hand-waving. The holes' fills are
  mapped to specific Lean mathlib / Lean-core theorems in
  `2026-07-17-mailbox-inference-fixpoint-shape.md`.
