  `Otp.Meta.SendEffect` — obligation (2) made EFFECT-HONEST: the clause-derived pid
  message index and its send-safety survive the `Effect` discipline (`spawn`/`post`
  return `Effect(...)`, sequenced with monadic `let`). The module is re-checked every
  build via the stdlib preload; these tests pin the *safety content* under effects —
  a message not of the actor's derived type is rejected even when threaded through
  `effect_bind`, and a non-total handler still cannot form the actor.
