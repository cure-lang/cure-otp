  `Otp.Meta.Registry` — the "type must not lie" obligations (G7): a raw `Pid` is not a
  `GenServer` (F-2), and `whereis` is partial (`PidOption`, F-2c). The proof is
  re-checked every build via the stdlib preload; these tests pin the safety content —
  a bare `Pid` cannot be used where a typed server is expected, and a `whereis`
  consumer that ignores the absent case is rejected as non-total.
