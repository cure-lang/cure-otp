# Adequacy — the shape of tying `infer` to the metatheory, and its matches

*2026-07-17. The one piece of G9 I had called "no external match" — connecting `infer(behaviour)`
to the operational safety theorems — turns out to decompose into three parts, EACH with a
concrete matching shape in the cloned references. The composition is novel; the pieces are not.*

**A precise comparison (NOT "ahead").** Proof of Delivery (Rocq) and Cure's `Std.Otp.*`
mechanized COMPLEMENTARY halves, and neither dominates:
- PoD mechanized the mailbox-type ALGEBRA richly — patterns as COMMUTATIVE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS,
  derivatives, subtyping — and DEFERRED the operational semantics + preservation theorem.
- Cure has an operational reduction + a PRESERVATION theorem — but only for the TAG-SET fragment
  (an interface is a flat accepted-set), the DEGENERATE case of PoD's patterns.
So Cure already has the operational-preservation PIECE PoD deferred, but at a much LOWER type
expressiveness; on the type language itself (patterns, subtyping) PoD is well ahead. The two are
complementary, not ranked.

## The shape

**Adequacy = the fundamental theorem of type soundness, parameterized by inference:** the
statically-inferred interface is preserved by the operational reduction of the behaviour it was
inferred from — so a process typed by inference never delivers a message it cannot handle. It
decomposes:

1. **`config ⊨ interface` — the semantic relation.** A configuration satisfies an interface
   when every message in flight and in its mailbox is accepted by it. In the tag-set fragment
   this is `AllMember(ether, I) ∧ AllMember(mailbox, I)` (`WTat` in
   `scaffolds/inference_adequacy.cure`); in the full theory it is the commutative-regex-PATTERN
   relation, order-insensitive.

2. **Preservation at the inferred interface — the operational half.** `config ⊨ I` is preserved
   by every typed step (`preservation_at`, PROVED in the scaffold). This is `Otp.Meta.Preservation`
   generalized from a fixed accepted-set to an arbitrary interface `I = infer(b)`.

3. **The bridge — inference ⇒ semantic typing.** That `b`'s operational steps are all typed at
   `infer(b)` — its sends land in `infer(b)`, its receives are handled — is the COVERAGE the
   constraint generator provides; composed with (2) over the run, it gives adequacy
   (`?adequacy`, the hole; provable for the first-order fold, needs the frontier `lfp` for
   recursion).

## The matches (all in cloned references)

| Adequacy piece | Matching shape |
|---|---|
| **1. `config ⊨ pattern` relation** (order-insensitive) | **Proof of Delivery** (Rocq, the PDF in this dir): "patterns as a RELATION between a configuration and a pattern, via list permutations, instead of infinite multisets" — the exact shape, mechanized. Also my `Std.Otp.WT`/`WTat` for the tag fragment. |
| **2. operational preservation** | **PLFA** `preserve` (Agda STLC subject reduction) — the canonical shape my `Otp.Meta.Preservation`/`Safety` already mirror. **Proof of Delivery EXPLICITLY LEAVES THIS OPEN** for mailbox types ("a full account of Pat's operational semantics and preservation theorem … is left [for future work]"). So Cure already HAS what the SOTA mechanization deferred. |
| **3. fundamental-theorem bridge** (syntactic typing ⇒ semantic) | **Actris** `actris/logrel/term_typing_judgment.v` + `term_typing_rules.v` — the semantic typing judgment `⊨` (`ltyped`) and each syntactic rule proven semantically sound (`ltyped_var`, `ltyped_subsumption`, …). The logical-relations fundamental lemma. |

## The upshot

Nothing in adequacy is unmatched. The static relation ports from Proof of Delivery; the bridge
from Actris's logical relation; the operational preservation Cure already has (and is the piece
PoD deferred). The genuinely NEW work is the COMPOSITION — proving the three fit together over
*this* project's `Std.Otp.*` reduction — but every part has a shape to port, and the hardest
part (operational preservation for mailbox-typed configurations) is done.

**DONE — `Otp.Meta.InferenceAdequacy` (`metatheory/src/otp_inference_adequacy.cure`).** The
SEQUENTIAL and BRANCHING first-order fragment (`BNil`/`BRecv`/`BSend`/`BSeq`) is now PROVED end
to end, no holes: `preservation_at` (subject reduction at `infer(b)`), `coverage`
(`SendsIn(b,t) ⟹ Member(t, infer(b))`) including the `BSeq` branches via
`member_append_left`/`member_append_right`, and `adequacy` (every reachable config is
`WTat(c, infer(b))`), Idris-mirrored `rel=same`. This is the mailbox-inference adequacy the
literature has only STATED, mechanized against an operational reduction — the operational half
Proof of Delivery deferred, tied to inference. Two things turned out NOT to be deep gaps: the
`?adequacy` block was resolved by making the config argument IMPLICIT so the recursive call
infers the intermediate config from `prev`'s type; and BRANCHING — previously thought
erasure-blocked because `member_append_right` needs `infer(l)` relevantly while `l` is an
existential index — was resolved by matching the DATA (behaviour) before the EVIDENCE
(`SendsIn`), which binds `l`/`r`/`k` by name and prunes impossible evidence constructors (the E1
structure in `2026-07-17-proof-authoring-elaborator-ergonomics-design.md`), with no TCB change.
What remains: RECURSION (`BRec`) needs the frontier `lfp` — it stays in
`scaffolds/inference_adequacy.cure`.
